## 0.5.0 - 2025-05-14

- Now targets `pants` version `2.24`.

## 0.4.0 - 2024-09-19

- Now targets `pants` version `2.22`.
- Kubeconfig files are no longer automatically picked up from the host. In order to support scripted
  provisioning and local configuration files, all targets now take a `kubeconfig` field. This can
  point to either `kubeconfig` target which uses a straight source or a generated, or a
  `host_kubeconfig` target which will attempt to load from `~/.kube/config`. Both of these also
  allow you to specify default namespaces, contexts, clusters and users. All these fields can now
  also be specified on the object, whereas only cluster/context could before.
